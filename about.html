		<h1>ABOUT US</h1>
		<h2>Our Company:</h2>
			<p>
				DSALD Parts was established in 1886 by Edward Dsald. Edward was
				born of Irish immigrants who instilled in him the value of hard work. Having spent
				many years working for others in the spare parts industry, Edward decided it was time
				to put all of his years of knowledge and experience and invest it in himself. With the help of
				his then business partner Howard Busey, the first DSALD Parts store was opened in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.
				The company now has over 500 total stores in 48 states.

		<h2>Our Mission:</h2>
			<p>
				Our Mission is to provide high quality spare parts at affordable prices. Due to having many years 
				of experience in the spare parts business and through strategic sourcing, DSALD Parts is able to provide 
				better quality parts at much lower prices than our competitors. Customer Satisfaction is also one
				of our primary goals. We go through extreme lengths to ensure that the customer is very satisfied with 
				each purchase
